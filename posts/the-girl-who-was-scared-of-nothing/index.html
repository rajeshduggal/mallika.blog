The night before Halloween two best friends were talking about their fears. Emily said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of nothing.&rdquo;
On Halloween night Emily and Lily went trick-or-treating. Lily was shy and curious but Emily was boastful.

<p><em>An original story by Mallika Duggal. Written November 2018.</em></p>

<p>The night before Halloween two best friends were talking about their fears. Emily said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On Halloween night Emily and Lily went trick-or-treating.  Lily was shy and curious but Emily was boastful. As they walked a ghost appeared and then disappeared mysteriously. &ldquo;Ahhh!&rdquo; cried Emily but Lily looked curious.  &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; Emily said to Lily. But Lily had disappeared.</p>

<p>Just then a note from Lily fell and said &ldquo;Help! A ghost has captured me!&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Suddenly the ghost came, but Emily was too fast for it. She threw it to the ground and there were birds flying and a white sheet was on the ground. Just then Lily appeared from behind a spooky house and said &ldquo;So you are scared of something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>THE END.</p>
