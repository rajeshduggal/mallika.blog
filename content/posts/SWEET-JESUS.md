Today, I went to [Sweet Jesus](https://www.sweetjesusicecream.com/) which is an over-priced ice-cream shop. The flavour of ice-cream I got was called "Bangin' Brownie". My brother got Rocky-Road Rage. Mine was crumbles of brownie, chocolate sauce, and caramel sauce to stick it to the chocolate ice-cream.  My brother's had marshmellows, nuts, chocolate sauce sticking to chocolate ice-cream.

Next time I will get an ice-cream flavour called Krusty-Cone.  On the Krusty-Cone is four pieces of cotton candy sticking out of a vanilla ice-cream cone, with sprinkles on top.  My brother would get Krusty-Cone too. I recommend it to everybody who loves ice-cream.  If you don't want the over-priced ones you can get a vanilla, chocolate, or a twist of vanilla and chocolate.  So on a hot day you should definitely get this ice-cream.
