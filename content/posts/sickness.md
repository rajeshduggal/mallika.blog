It all started on July 6<sup>th</sup> 2019. I was feeling very hot and was coughing a lot. My day was fine, I was resting and taking [Tylenol](https://www.tylenol.ca/), but then, on the second night. I had rough coughing fits throughout the night.

My mum said I should take lozenges but it wasn't comfortable because I didn't like the flavour because it was honey lemon flavour. Disgusting! I had it in my mouth for five minutes, but it was too gross so I had to spit it out.  I still had coughing fits but it was much better thanks to the lozenge.

The next morning, I was still having coughing fits that were better than the night before.  I tried to handle them but they were too uncomfortable.  Fortunately, I managed through the day.

That same day it was my baby cousin's birthday. I had to miss it. What a bummer.  My brother could have gone but he said he wanted to stay with me.  So the whole family didn't go that day.  I was so disappointed, I had to make Sia a gift anyway.  I made her a card, but [someone](http://daxduggal.com) turned it into a paper airplane. I didn't have anything to give to Sia, so I looked through my stuff to find what I had.  Thankfully, I found a decent picture of a meadow. I'm making her two more gifts right now.

Today, on July 17<sup>th</sup> 2019, I am feeling much much better.  And, I'm getting ready for a play date with my cousins tomorrow!  Finally, I'll give Sia my two gifts.

Let's hope I get better fast.
