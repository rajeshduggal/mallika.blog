Page 1:

Rude Ramsay resided in a ramshackle rectangular residence with a roof garden, a root cellar, and a revolving door. A rampart ranged down the right-hand side of the run-down real-estate.

Residing with Rude Ramsay, who was red-haired, were his revolting relatives, Ron, Rollo and Ruby. There were rotund but robust, and when they were regaling themselves with rum, they relaxed in their recliners, replaying reams of retro rock'n'roll records relentlessly. This could be rigorous.
