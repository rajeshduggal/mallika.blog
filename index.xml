      <description>An original story by Mallika Duggal. Written November 2018.
The night before Halloween two best friends were talking about their fears. Emily said &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m afraid of nothing.&amp;rdquo;
On Halloween night Emily and Lily went trick-or-treating. Lily was shy and curious but Emily was boastful. As they walked a ghost appeared and then disappeared mysteriously. &amp;ldquo;Ahhh!&amp;rdquo; cried Emily but Lily looked curious. &amp;ldquo;What was that?&amp;rdquo; Emily said to Lily. But Lily had disappeared.</description>
