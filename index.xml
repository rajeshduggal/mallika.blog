      <description>By Margaret Atwood (page 1) Page 1:
Rude Ramsay resided in a ramshackle rectangular residence with a roof garden, a root cellar, and a revolving door. A rampart ranged down the right-hand side of the run-down real-estate.
Residing with Rude Ramsay, who was red-haired, were his revolting relatives, Ron, Rollo and Ruby. There were rotund but robust, and when they were regaling themselves with rum, they relaxed in their recliners, replaying reams of retro rock&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;roll records relentlessly.</description>

      <description>In ancient times what you wore depended on where you were. Say for example, if you lived in medieval England you would probably have worn a sleeved tunic. But if you lived in ancient Rome you would have worn a sleeveless toga. Medieval England was based on a feudal society. The slaves in medieval England and ancient Rome would do what the landlords ordered to do to earn money. Slaves and peasants could starve to death in the spring due to lack of food.</description>

      <description>An original story by Mallika Duggal. Written November 2018.
The night before Halloween two best friends were talking about their fears. Emily said &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m afraid of nothing.&amp;rdquo;
On Halloween night Emily and Lily went trick-or-treating. Lily was shy and curious but Emily was boastful. As they walked a ghost appeared and then disappeared mysteriously. &amp;ldquo;Ahhh!&amp;rdquo; cried Emily but Lily looked curious. &amp;ldquo;What was that?&amp;rdquo; Emily said to Lily. But Lily had disappeared.</description>
